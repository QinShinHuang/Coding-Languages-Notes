## Linux File Management Commands

In Linux, creating, removing, moving, and copying files and directories is done with simple commands. Below are the most important ones to know.

---

### 1. `touch` – Create Empty Files or Update Timestamps

The `touch` command is used to create a new empty file or update the last modified time of an existing file.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  touch filename
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  touch notes.txt          # creates an empty file
  touch file1 file2 file3  # creates multiple files
  ```

---

### 2. `rm` – Remove (Delete) Files and Directories

The `rm` command permanently deletes files (and with options, directories). There is no “Recycle Bin,” so use caution.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  rm filename
  ```
* **Options:**

  * `rm -i file.txt` → interactive mode (asks before deleting)
  * `rm -r folder/` → delete a directory and its contents (recursive)
  * `rm -f file.txt` → force delete without confirmation

---

### 3. `mkdir` – Make Directories

This command creates new directories (folders).

* **Usage:**

  ```
  mkdir dirname
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  mkdir projects        # create a directory
  mkdir -p a/b/c        # create nested directories in one step
  ```

---

### 4. `rmdir` – Remove Empty Directories

Deletes a directory, but **only if it’s empty**. For non-empty directories, use `rm -r`.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  rmdir dirname
  ```

* **Example:**

  ```
  rmdir old_folder
  ```

---

### 5. `mv` – Move or Rename Files and Directories

The `mv` command is used both to move files/directories and to rename them.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  mv source destination
  ```
* **Examples:**

  ```
  mv notes.txt ~/Documents/     # move file into Documents
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt    # rename a file
  mv dir1 dir2/                 # move a directory
  ```

---

### 6. `cp` – Copy Files and Directories

The `cp` command creates duplicates of files and directories.

* **Usage:**

  ```
  cp source destination
  ```
* **Options:**

  * `cp file1 file2` → copy file1 to file2
  * `cp file.txt ~/backup/` → copy into backup directory
  * `cp -r dir1 dir2/` → copy a directory and its contents (recursive)

---

## Quick Practice

1. Create an empty file called `demo.txt`.

   ```
   touch demo.txt
   ```
2. Make a directory named `testdir`.

   ```
   mkdir testdir
   ```
3. Move `demo.txt` into `testdir`.

   ```
   mv demo.txt testdir/
   ```
4. Copy `demo.txt` back into your home directory.

   ```
   cp testdir/demo.txt ~/
   ```
5. Remove `demo.txt` from `testdir`.

   ```
   rm testdir/demo.txt
   ```
6. Remove the now-empty directory `testdir`.

   ```
   rmdir testdir
   ```

---

**Key Takeaway:**

* `touch` creates files.
* `rm` and `rmdir` remove files and directories.
* `mkdir` makes directories.
* `mv` moves or renames.
* `cp` copies.

These are the fundamental commands for managing files in Linux.

## Practice Exercises: File Management Commands

Work through the following exercises to reinforce your understanding. Each question is followed by the correct command.

---

### Exercise 1: Creating Files

1. Create an empty file named `notes.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   touch notes.txt
   ```

2. Create three files: `a.txt`, `b.txt`, and `c.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 2: Making Directories

1. Create a directory named `projects`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   mkdir projects
   ```

2. Create a nested directory structure `work/code/python`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   mkdir -p work/code/python
   ```

---

### Exercise 3: Moving and Renaming

1. Move `notes.txt` into the `projects` directory.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   mv notes.txt projects/
   ```

2. Rename the file `a.txt` to `alpha.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   mv a.txt alpha.txt
   ```

---

### Exercise 4: Copying

1. Copy `b.txt` into the `projects` directory.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   cp b.txt projects/
   ```

2. Copy the entire `work` directory into `backup`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   cp -r work backup
   ```

---

### Exercise 5: Removing

1. Delete the file `c.txt`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   rm c.txt
   ```

2. Remove the empty directory `backup`.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   rmdir backup
   ```

3. Delete a non-empty directory `projects` and everything inside it.
   **Answer:**

   ```
   rm -r projects
   ```

---

### Challenge: Combining Commands

1. Create a directory called `testlab`.
2. Inside it, create two empty files: `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.
3. Copy `file1.txt` to your home directory.
4. Rename `file2.txt` to `final.txt`.
5. Delete the `testlab` directory and its contents.

**Answer:**

```
mkdir testlab
touch testlab/file1.txt testlab/file2.txt
cp testlab/file1.txt ~/
mv testlab/file2.txt testlab/final.txt
rm -r testlab
```
